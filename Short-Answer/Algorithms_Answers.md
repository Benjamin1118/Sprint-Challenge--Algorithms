#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  O(n): number of loops is based off of n


b) O(n^2): when checking on n twice it becomes n^2


c) O(n): this is a recusion so it recuces to 0

## Exercise II
start = n[0]
end = len(n)
middle = range(start, len(n)) //2
#while start <= end:
    test = drop_egg(middle)
        #if egg breaks too high take off last half of #floors
        if egg breaks:
            end = middle
            middle = range(0, end)//2
            print(middle)
            test.drop_egg(middle)


        #if egg survives try a higher height, remove # #    first half

        else:
            start = middle
            middle = range(start, len(n))//2
            print(middle)
            test. drop_egg(middle)
